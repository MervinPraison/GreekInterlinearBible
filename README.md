Greek NT: Byzantine/Majority Text (2000)
The Greek New Testament according to the Byzantine Textform, edited by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont, 2000 edition
   This is the edition by Pierpont and Robinson of a Majority, or Byzantine, text of the NT. It is similar to an earlier production 
   of Hodges and Farstad in being based on von Soden's apparatus, but without their stemmatic reconstruction of the Apocalypse and 
   the Pericope Adulterae.

Greek NT: Tischendorf 8th Ed.The Greek Text corresponds to the printed text found in:

Tischendorf, Constantinus, Novum Testamentum Graece, editio octava critica major Vol. I, 1869; Vol. II 1872, Leipzig:Giesecke and Devrient. Vol 3, Prolegomena, ed. by Caspar Rene' Gregory, Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1894.

The text contains no accents or diacritical marks. 

This text was prepared from the Westcott-Hort-Nestle Aland text found in the Greek text prepared by Dr. Maurice Robinson. The text was compared to the printed edition of Tischendorf's. Changes were made in the text to make it correspond to the printed edition. The text was proofed against the Tischendorf text.

According to J. Harold Greenlee "His 'eighth major edition' (1869-72) contains a critical apparatus which has never been equaled in comprehensiveness of citation of Greek mss., versions, and patristic evidence. A century later it is still indispensable for serious work in the text of the N.T."

The Greek text is released as a public domain text.

If any errors are found in this text please let me know as soon as possible.
